# 👾 404saint — Tesla

**Red Team Operator | Offensive Security Specialist | Cyber Recon & Exploitation Expert**

Yo, I’m Tesla — a relentless penetration tester and offensive security hacker from Rwanda. I don’t just break things; I weaponize knowledge, automate chaos, and turn complex networks into playgrounds for advanced attacks. If you want someone who can blend *hands-on skill* with *strategic thinking*, you just found him.

### 🎯 My Offensive Security Philosophy

> “If you can’t exploit it, you don’t understand it. If you understand it, you can defend it. But I prefer offense — because that’s where real learning lives.”

No smoke, no mirrors — just raw technical skill, curiosity, and relentless hands-on work. I document everything so the next red team can come back stronger.
